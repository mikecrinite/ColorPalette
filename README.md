# ColorPalette
A simple app that allows a user to either take a photo, select one from the gallery, or enter a hex color code, and then creates a color palette based on the user's selection

### Planned features
* Display the name of the closest known color
* Scrape Wikipedia's color page regularly for a full list of colors automatically (currently, it only does this when a python script is run) and correctly (there's a possibility that the color names aren't being correctly associated with their hex codes, but I haven't had a chance to look at every single one yet)
* Save a color palette for future use
